# The More of Less, by Joshua Becker

### Chapter 2

+ Find the things that make you happy and center your life around them.
+ Get rid of the things that aren't necessary to better pursue your goals in life.
+ Removing physical distractions can help you achieve your priorities.
+ Rather than living with nothing, choose to live with the possessions that give you the life you want.
+ Minimalism is not about organizing and rearranging. That just keeps the clutter in another place.
+ Organizing and rearranging don't remove our desire to buy more things. It gives us a free pass to hold on to our excess spending instead of forcing us to come to terms with it.
+ Organizing is a temporary relief. Don't fall for it!
+ When you remove an item, it's gone for good! When you rearrange it, you're just delaying the inevitable.

### Chapter 3

+ The goal of minimalism is to unburden our lives so we can accomplish more.
+ Your version of minimalism will be different from someone else's.
+ Being a minimalist isn't about following some one-size-fits-all piece of advice.

### Chapter 4

+ Consumerism feels normal and natural to us. It's what we've grown up with.
+ Consumeristic propaganda is everywhere. It permeates public discourse and influences our lives.
+ This is a blind spot that we have, and it's one tha we have to come to terms with.

### Chapter 5

+ Amazon (and e-commerce in general) is a big problem when it comes to consumer spending.
+ When anything you want is just two days away, it's easy to make a purchase without giving it a second thought.
+ One family spent $2500/year on small, sub-$40 items a few at a time because of the ease of online shopping.
+ We're not being forced to buy these products. We personally make the decision to overspend and overaccumulate

### Chapter 6

+ Everyone has their own definition of what "clutter" is.
+ Find one that works for you, and remove everything that fits it.
+ For example, Joshua Fields Millburn considers it "anything that does not add value to his life". Marie Kondo describes it as "things that do not spark joy".
+ Other definitions include "anything that interferes with the life you could be living", or "things that you know to not be useful or don't believe to be beautiful".
+ These aren't the only four existing definitions, but they're good approaches to begin shaping your own definition.
+ The most important thing here is to **take action**. Thinking and talking about decluttering don't provide any real benefits other than a dopamine rush.

### Chapter 9

+ Find values and habits that help support your definition of minimalism.
+ For me, this means **cutting down on blogs/sites that recommend things to buy**.
  + I tend to make a lot of purchasing decisions through The Wirecutter and PackHacker, and will sometimes go on these sites **simply to browse and find something to buy**.
  + I'll also randomly visit Slickdeals just to see if there's a good deal -- not because I already have something in mind.
  + Cutting down on the time I spend on sites like these will be tremendously helpful.

### Chapter 11

+ When discarding things to suit your lifestyle, selling them is not worth the trouble.
+ The exception would be big-ticket items (my definition would be "things $100 and above").


### One Example

Books are a hot topic when it comes to minimalism. For some reason, people are obsessed with the idea that **to become a true minimalist, you can't own many books**.

This is completely false. If the books you own bring happiness in your life, **you should keep them**. The idea is to **keep the books that you love**, and discard the ones that you don't care for.
