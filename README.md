# tsundoku

[Tsundoku (Japanese: 積ん読) is acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku)

## Repo Goals

+ Create a reasonable order for reading through my backlog of books, along with a method for abandoning one
+ Write summaries of the books I've read
+ Discard the physical copies if I own them, either by means of selling or donating to others
+ Fiction/nonfiction books only. Textbooks/technical books don't apply here.

## Approach

+ Read the same book for at least fifteen uninterrupted minutes daily
+ If I'm no longer engaged with the book after one week, move on to the next
